      The team with the most losers at the end of the season wins.
    </uib-accordion-group>
    <uib-accordion-group heading="What do I win?">
      That is between you and the commish of the league. However, please be careful when dealing with money. Don’t send money to anyone you don’t know. Common sense, please.

    <uib-accordion-group heading="When is the deadline to make my pick?">
      As long as a game hasn't started, you can make a pick for that game. But make sure you make a pick before the week ends.
    </uib-accordion-group>
    <uib-accordion-group heading="Can I pick the same loser twice?">
      Nope. Unless you make the playoffs where all losers are once again available to pick.
    </uib-accordion-group>
    <uib-accordion-group heading="Do ties count as a loss?">
      Negative. But, in some Survivor leagues you will not get eliminated for a tie. Check your league rules.

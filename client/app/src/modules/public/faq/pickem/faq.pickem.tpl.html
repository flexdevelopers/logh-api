      Pick the most losers for the week and win the week.

    <uib-accordion-group heading="What do I win?">
      That is between you and the commish of the league. However, please be careful when dealing with money. Don’t send money to anyone you don’t know. Common sense, please.
    </uib-accordion-group>
    <uib-accordion-group heading="How many losers do I pick each week?">
      That is up to the commish. Check your league rules.
    </uib-accordion-group>
    <uib-accordion-group heading="When is the deadline to make my picks?">
      As long as the game hasn't started, you can make a pick for that game.
    </uib-accordion-group>
    <uib-accordion-group heading="Can I pick the same loser twice?">
      Yes sir.
    </uib-accordion-group>
    <uib-accordion-group heading="Do ties count as a loss?">
      No ma'am. But, for NHL, overtime or shootout losses will be treated as a loss and not a tie.

    <uib-accordion-group heading="When is the deadline to join a Pick'em league?">
      <a ng-click="joinLeague(selectedSeasonId)">Join</a> anytime.
    </uib-accordion-group>
    <uib-accordion-group heading="What if I fail to make picks for a week?">
      I'm guessing you won't win that week.

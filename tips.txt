Season

- When creating a new season, set the start date in the future to avoid it showing up on the site before it is ready. When it is ready, change the start date.
- The end date of a season, should be the end date of the season's last week

Week

- The end date of a week should ideally be the start date of the last week's game
- When creating weeks, check the weeks first to determine if you have to combine some. Keep in mind all star weeks.

League

Game

- Once you know a game is postponed, mark it as postponed. If the game is rescheduled during that week, change the start date and remove PPD, else leave PPD and don't worry about it.
- Make sure to mark playoff games as playoff so NHL can compute record the right way (no ties)
- when a playoff round starts, blank out the records for teams that play in a series

Squad

- When a season goes into the playoffs, maybe you should set the seed?

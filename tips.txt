Season

- When creating a new season, set the start date in the future to avoid it showing up on the site before it is ready. When it is ready, change the start date.
- The end date of a season, should be the end date of the season's last week

Week

- The end date of a week should ideally be the start date of the last week's game
- When creating weeks, check the weeks first to determine if you have to combine some. Keep in mind all star weeks.

League

Game

- Don't create games until you are sure they will be played. i.e. playoff games
- Don't mark games as postponed BEFORE the game's starts_at. This would lock any picks for that game. Give people the opportunity to change their pick before the game was supposed to start.

Squad

- When a season goes into the playoffs, maybe you should set the seed?
